# Very_Basic_Flaskapp
This was my first exposure to flask and its capabilities, i came back to edit this and practise embedding. 

I created a candlestick chart which is able to take a stock ticker (currently GOOG) and create a graph within a specified timeframe (which you can also specify)
I haven't created a main personal website as a portfolio and i wanted this to be this, therefore embedding was my first step in understanding the process.

I have included the jupyter notebook file, where you are able to change the stock ticker
